					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 style="text-align:center">2. Overview of ACEX sale</h3>
				<br />
				<p>
					ACEX is required for proper operation and comprehensive utilization of
					ACEX SDN. BHD. (as defined in the white paper (the “White Paper”)
					provided at <a href=" https://acex.trade">https://acex.trade</a> (the
					“Website”) as of the date the Purchaser acquires ACEX token). After
					the ACEX sale, each ACEX is backed by the purchase of the underlying
					assets, as described in the White Paper. To the extent they do not
					contradict these Terms, the rights connected to ACEX are subject to
					the limitations set out in the White Paper, but this should in no case
					create obligations for the Company in addition to the ones contained
					in these Terms. The Company reserves the right to circumvent the
					algorithm used to select the underlying assets if it believes, in its
					sole discretion, that such selected underlying assets could adversely
					affect the Company or ACEX from a regulatory or legal perspective. The
					Company shall have the right to sell any such underlying assets (if
					already part of ACEX portfolio) and block their acquisition.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The maximum total amount of ACEXs to be issued is 863,000,000 (roughly
					equivalent to US$25,000,000). ACEXs are generated as Purchasers buy
					them and the total supply of ACEXs will be fixed after the end of the
					ACEX sale. No more ACEXs will be sold after the end of the ACEX sale,
					as described in the preceding paragraph. Ownership of ACEX during the
					ACEX token sale carries no rights express or implied. Purchases of
					ACEX are non-refundable.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3 style="text-align:center;">3. ACEX Price</h3>
				<br />
				<p>
					Purchasers in the ACEX token sale will be allocated their ACEX tokens
					in exchange for ETH at the following rate:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>all ACEX tokens: US$ 0.10 per ACEX token;</li>
					<p>
						The US Dollars to ETH exchange rate is used to dynamically set the
						ETH to ACEX rate. As a result, for the duration of the ACEX sale,
						the price to purchase a ACEX will be set as an amount in ETH.
					</p>
					<p>
						Purchaser must have an Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC-20
						token standard in order to receive any ACEX purchased from the
						Company.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">4. Timing of ACEX Token Sale</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The general public will be able to see the total number of ACEX
						tokens currently sold, as well as the distribution of all ACEX
						tokens between the participating Ethereum accounts. In the spirit of
						openness, the Company will constantly update on the Website the
						number of tokens sold as well as the share of ACEX tokens allocated
						to the shareholders of Company. Furthermore, the Ethereum accounts
						used to store ETH during the ACEX sale duration will publically
						available and their balances will also be made available on the
						Website.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">5. After the ACEX Token Sale</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Purchasers should have no expectation of influence over
						governance of the Company.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon the conclusion of a successful ACEX sale, the digital assets
						backing each ACEX token will be transparently purchased.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Company will provide you with an official and regular audit
						conducted on the existence of the digital assets backing each ACEX
						token. Through this audit, you can track and confirm that the
						digital assets backing your ACEX have been received and acquired.
						Access to the audit results does not constitute a ACEX purchase
						receipt or indicate in any way that the party possessing such access
						has rights to or ownership of the purchased ACEX tokens.
					</p>
					<p>
						Prior to a Purchaser selling ACEX after the ACEX token sale
						completion, such Purchaser shall ensure that the buyer of any such
						ACEX undertakes to comply with all the provisions of these Terms as
						if such person were a Purchaser in the ACEX token sale.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">
						6. The Company Will Not Purchase ACEX During the ACEX Sale
					</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Company warrants that neither it nor its shareholders will
						purchase ACEX during the ACEX sale. Furthermore, the Company
						warrants that neither it nor its shareholders will purchase ACEX
						from any third party during the period of the ACEX sale.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">7. All purchases of ACEX are final</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						ALL PURCHASES OF ACEX ARE FINAL. PURCHASES OF ACEX ARE
						NON-REFUNDABLE. BY PURCHASING ACEX, THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
						NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS OR
						SHAREHODELRS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON.
					</p>
					<p>
						IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, THAT ANY
						INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES OWNING ACEX CREATES MATERIAL REGULATORY OR
						OTHER LEGAL RISKS OR ADVERSE EFFECTS FOR THE COMPANY AND/OR ACEX,
						THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO: (A) BUY ALL ACEX FROM SUCH ACEX
						OWNERS AT THE THEN-EXISTING MARKET PRICE AND/OR (B) SELL ALL
						CRYPTOCURRENCY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">
						8. Taxation of ACEX and Taxation Related to the ICO
					</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine if the
						purchase of ACEX with BTC, LTC, ETH or the potential appreciation or
						depreciation in the value of ACEX over time has tax implications for
						the Purchaser in the Purchaser's home jurisdiction. By purchasing
						ACEX, and to the extent permitted by law, the Purchaser agrees not
						to hold any of the Company, its affiliates, shareholders, director,
						or advisors liable for any tax liability associated with or arising
						from the purchase of ACEX.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">9. Privacy</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Purchasers may be contacted by email by the Company. Such emails
						will be informational only. The Company will not request any
						information from Purchasers in an email. See our Privacy Policy
						available on the Website for additional information
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">10. Force Majeure</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The ACEX SDN. BHD. Team is not liable for failure to perform solely
						caused by:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>unavoidable casualty,</li>
						<li>delays in delivery of materials,</li>
						<li>embargoes,</li>
						<li>government orders,</li>
						<li>acts of civil or military authorities,</li>
						<li>acts by common carriers,</li>
						<li>emergency conditions (including weather conditions),</li>
						<li>security issues arising from the technology used,</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						or any similar unforeseen event that renders performance
						commercially implausible. If an event of force majeure occurs, the
						party injured by the other's inability to perform may elect to
						suspend the Terms, in whole or part, for the duration of the force
						majeure circumstances. The party experiencing the force majeure
						circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in
						all reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure on the
						injured party.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						THE PURCHASER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE PURCHASER IS PURCHASING ACEX
						AT THE PURCHASER'S SOLE RISK AND THAT ACEX IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
						BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
						INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED
						WARRANTIES, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
						(EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WITH ANY
						LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM
						FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED). WITHOUT LIMITING THE
						FOREGOING, NONE OF THE ACEX SDN. BHD. TEAM WARRANTS THAT THE PROCESS
						FOR PURCHASING ACEX WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">12. Limitations Waiver of Liability</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
						PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY
						CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER
						CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO (i) USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, ACEX OR
						(ii) THE ACEX SDN. BHD. TEAM UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF
						ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS
						FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING
						NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NONE OF THE ACEX SDN. BHD. TEAM SHALL BE LIABLE
						FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL
						DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY
						WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, OR
						PURCHASE OF, OR INABILITY TO PURCHASE, ACEX, OR ARISING OUT OF ANY
						INTERACTION WITH THE SMART CONTRACT IMPLEMENTED IN RELATION TO ACEX.
						THE PURCHASER FURTHER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE ACEX SDN.
						BHD. TEAM IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING
						OTHER PURCHASERS OF ACEX, AND THAT THE RISK OF PURCHASING AND USING
						ACEX RESTS ENTIRELY WITH THE PURCHASER. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE
						UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY OF THE ACEX
						SDN. BHD. TEAM BE LIABLE TO ANY PURCHASER FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT
						THE PURCHASER HAVE PAID TO THE COMPANY FOR THE PURCHASE OF ACEX.
						SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES
						OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF
						DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION
						AND ELSEWHERE IN THE TERMS MAY NOT APPLY TO A PURCHASER. IN
						PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS
						OF ANY PURCHASER OR EXCLUDE INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILFUL
						MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OF THE ACEX SDN. BHD. TEAM.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">13. Complete Agreement</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						These Terms set forth the entire understanding between the Purchaser
						and the Company with respect to the purchase and sale of ACEX. For
						facts relating to the sale and purchase, the Purchaser agrees to
						rely only on the Terms in determining purchase decisions and
						understands that the Terms govern the sale of ACEX and supersede any
						public statements about the ACEX token sale made by third parties or
						by the ACEX SDN. BHD. Team or individuals associated with any of the
						ACEX SDN. BHD. Team, past and present and during the ACEX token
						sale.
					</p>
					<h3 style="text-align:center">14. Severability</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Purchaser and the Company agree that if any portion of these

					<h4 style="text-align:center;">
						<strong>ANNEX A</strong>
					</h4>
					<h4 style="text-align:center;">ACEX Risks</h4>
					<p>
						By purchasing, owning, and using ACEX, you expressly acknowledge and
						assume the following risks:
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong
							>1. Risk​ ​of​ ​Losing​ ​Access​ ​to​ ​ACEX​ ​Due​ ​to​ ​Loss​
							​of​ ​Private​ ​Key(s),​ ​Custodial​ ​Error​ ​or​ ​Purchaser
							Error</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to
						control and dispose of ACEX stored in your digital wallet or vault.
						Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your
						digital wallet or vault storing ACEX will result in loss of such
						ACEX. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private
						key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted
						wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your ACEX. Any
						errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital
						wallet or vault you choose to receive and store ACEX in, including
						your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or
						vault, may also result in the loss of your ACEX. Additionally, your
						failure to follow precisely the procedures set forth in for buying
						and receiving Tokens, including, for instance, if you provide the
						wrong address for the receiving ACEX, or provides an address that is
						not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong
							>2. Risks​ ​Associated​ ​with​ ​the​ ​Ethereum​ ​Protocol</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Because ACEX and the ACEX SDN. BHD. platform are based on the
						Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the
						Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the platform
						or ACEX. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances
						such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to
						the ACEX and the platform, including the utility of the ACEX for
						obtaining services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic
						consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.
					</p>
					<p><strong>3. Risk​ ​of​ ​Mining​ ​Attacks</strong></p>
					<p>
						As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the
						Ethereum protocol, ACEX are susceptible to attacks by miners in the
						course of validating ACEX transactions on the Ethereum blockchain,
						including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining
						power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks
						present a risk to the platform and ACEX, including, but not limited
						to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving ACEX.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong
							>4. Risk​ ​of​ ​Hacking​ ​and​ ​Security​ ​Weaknesses</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to
						interfere with the platform or ACEX in a variety of ways, including,
						but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
						consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing.
						Furthermore, because the platform is based on open-source software,
						there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team
						may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the
						core infrastructure of the platform, which could negatively affect
						the platform and ACEX, including the utility of ACEX for obtaining
						services.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>5. Risks​ ​Associated​ ​with​ ​Markets​ ​for​ ​ACEX</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party
						exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to
						little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to
						fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties
						do ascribe an external exchange value to ACEX (e.g., as denominated
						in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely
						volatile.
					</p>
					<p><strong>6. Risk​ ​of​ ​Uninsured​ ​Losses</strong></p>
					<p>
						Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial
						institutions, ACEX are uninsured unless you specifically obtain
						private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss
						of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance
						arranged by Company, to offer recourse to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong
							>7. Risks​ ​Associated​ ​with​ ​Uncertain​ ​Regulations​ ​and​
							​Enforcement​ ​Actions</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						The regulatory status of ACEX and distributed ledger technology is
						unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to
						predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing
						regulation with respect to such technology and its applications,
						including the ACEX SDN. BHD. platform and ACEX. It is likewise
						difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory
						agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting
						distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the
						platform and ACEX. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the
						platform and ACEX in various ways, including, for purposes of
						illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale
						and delivery of ACEX constitutes unlawful activity or that ACEX are
						a regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of
						those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the
						purchase, sale and delivery thereof. The Company may cease
						operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions,
						or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such
						jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary
						regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
					</p>
					<p><strong>8. Risks​ ​Arising​ ​from​ ​Taxation</strong></p>
					<p>
						The tax characterization of ACEX is uncertain. You must seek your
						own tax advice in connection with purchasing ACEX, which may result
						in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes,
						income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
					</p>
					<p><strong>9. Risk​ ​of​ ​Competing​ ​platforms</strong></p>
					<p>
						It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that
						utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the
						platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially
						similar to the ACEX SDN. BHD. services.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong
							>10. Risks​ ​Arising​ ​from​ ​Lack​ ​of​ ​Governance​
							​Rights</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Because ACEX confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to
						the ACEX SDN. BHD. platform or the Company, all decisions involving
						the Company’s products or services within the platform or the
						Company itself will be made by the Company at its sole discretion.
						These decisions could adversely affect the platform and the utility
						of any ACEX you own, including their utility for obtaining services.
					</p>
					<p><strong>11. Unanticipated​ ​Risks</strong></p>
					<p>
						Cryptographic tokens such as ACEX are a new and untested technology.
						In addition to the risks included in this Annex A of these Terms,
						there are other risks associated with your purchase, possession and
						use of ACEX, including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further
						materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks
						discussed in this Annex A of these Terms.

									</li>
									<li>
										Any Reversion proceeds realized and due to me following a
										Reversion of ACEX tokens held by me at the point of
										Reversion ( <strong>Reversion Proceeds</strong>) in
										accordance with Token Sale Terms shall be paid to me as soon
										as practicable in the manner set forth in the Token Sale
										Terms. Contributed Amount or Reversion Proceeds shall be

										thereby materially adversely affecting the value of my
										Contributed Amount and/or Reversion Proceeds and potentially
										reducing one or both to zero. Furthermore, I acknowledge
										that any interest accruing with respect to such Contributed
										Amount and/or Reversion Proceeds held in this manner shall
										be for the benefit of ACEX SDN. BHD. only.

										application for ACEX tokens and shall not pay any Reversion
										Proceeds until all information required for verification
										purposes has been provided.
